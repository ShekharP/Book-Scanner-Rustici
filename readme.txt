The Rustici Book Scanner App relies on a third party library (or a separate app install). In order to build this app, you will need to get the ZXing Library (http://code.google.com/p/zxing/) and follow the instructions they provide for linking the libraries and creating the core.jar file.

This is a required dependency.  With a small amount of effort, the ZXing Library can be detached and instead require a Barcode Scanner based off the ZXing Library to installed on the device.
